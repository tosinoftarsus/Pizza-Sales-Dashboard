Pizza Sales Dashboard - Project (Power BI & Microsoft Excel)

Project Overview
I created this Power BI dashboard to analyze pizza sales and uncover key insights about revenue, order trends, and product performance. My goal was to make sense of the data and help stakeholders make smarter business decisions—like identifying best-selling pizzas, peak sales periods, and areas for improvement.

Goals & Key Questions
Which pizzas generate the most (and least) revenue?
When are peak sales periods?
What pizza sizes and categories are the most popular?
What is the average order size?
Are there trends that can help with inventory planning and promotions?
